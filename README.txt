## intro
In this project i have made my own neural network and made a model, now it can read integers in a image from 1 to 9
## Improvements
Scale the image size import instead of 28px by 28px so it realistic and train the model.
## import
If copying this code you need these library installed: 
pip install:
-opencv-python 
-numpy 
-tensorflow 
-matplotlib.
